== Project status

This project in its current status is in heavy development.
It got triggered by the lack of deep-merging YAML in modulesync configs and limitations in ERB templates.
It got inspired by Helm's templating mechanisms.
Most features are untested yet ("it works on my machine").

== The name

It's a short form for **G**it-**Repo-Sync**.
