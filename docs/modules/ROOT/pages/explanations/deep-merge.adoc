= Configuration deep merge

Template configuration from `config_defaults.yml` is merged with the config from `.sync.yml`.

There are a few rules of deep merging:

. Any array is being replaced entirely.
. The value type of a key can be overwritten.
. Keys not affected stay unchanged even in nested structures (except arrays).

[NOTE]
====
You should at least be familiar with the behaviour, as this greatly affects template development.
This is a major difference from ModuleSync.
