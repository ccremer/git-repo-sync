= Getting started
:control-repo: greposync-control
:managed-repo: my-repository

🏁 Goals::
. Set up a template repository
. Onboard a managed repository
. Commit the changes

== Prerequisites

NOTE: Currently, only Linux is supported.

You need the following tools installed in your `$PATH`.

* `git`
* `gsync`
* `editor` (Your favorite text editor)

Additionally, you need the following.

* A user account on github.com
* https://github.com/settings/keys[SSH key] associated with your GitHub account.
  See https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh[this article] if you need help.

[NOTE]
====
For the purpose of this guide, following repository names are being used:

- `{control-repo}`: The repository containing the config and templates.
- `{managed-repo}`: The test repository which we are going to be managing with {page-component-title}
====

== Setup template repository

In the first step, we're going to initialize a Git repository that contains the template.

. Create a new repository called `{control-repo}` in https://github.com/new[GitHub]

. Clone the new repository
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone <git-url>
----

. Initialize {page-component-name}
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd {control-repo}
gsync init
----

And that's it!
You should now see a structure similar to the following:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{control-repo}
├── config_defaults.yml
├── greposync.yml
├── managed_repos.yml
└── template
    ├── _helpers.tpl
    └── README.adoc
----

// There is more to come here!
