You need the following tools installed in your `$PATH`.

* `git`
* `gsync`
* `editor` (Your favorite text editor)

Additionally, you need the following.

* A user account on github.com
* https://github.com/settings/keys[SSH key] associated with your GitHub account.
  See https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh[this article] if you need help.
* https://github.com/settings/tokens[Personal Access Token (PAT)] to authenticate with GitHub API.
  Following scopes are required:
  - repo
  - workflow

.Export the PAT
[source,bash]
----
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
----

[NOTE]
====
For the purpose of this guide, following repository names are being used:

- `{control-repo}`: The repository containing the config and templates.
- `{managed-repo}`: The test repository which we are going to be managing with {page-component-title}
====

== Push an update to GitHub

. Run {page-component-name} again, but this time also push to remote
+
[source,bash]
----
gsync update --dry-run=push
----

. Inspect the Git log
+
[source,bash]
----
pushd repos/github.com/*/my-repository &> /dev/null
GIT_PAGER=cat git log --oneline
popd &> /dev/null
----
+
.Example Output
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
3637433 (HEAD -> {page-component-name}, origin/{page-component-name}) Update from {page-component-name} <1>
e6f6b79 Add .sync.yml
4bb2b9f Update from {page-component-name}
16ef4fe (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) Initial commit
----
<1> As you now can see, we have pushed the branch to origin.

== Create a new pull request

. Edit `greposync.yml` and set `pr.create=true`
+
[source,bash]
----
editor greposync.yml
----

. Run {page-component-name} again, but this time no more dry run
+
[source,bash]
----
gsync update
----

== Inspect the result

The update command should have printed the URL of your new pull request.
Visit the pull request on github.com and verify that it correctly applied the following settings:

- Subject
- Description
- Labels

[TIP]
====
If the commit branch and target branch stay unchanged, {page-component-name} should find and update the same pull request when you re-run the update with modifications.
