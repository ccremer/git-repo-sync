== Special values

`delete: true`::
When this flag is set, the target file is being deleted.
It is not rendered at all.

[TIP]
====
* Use this flag in `config_defaults.yml` to cleanup files that aren't needed in the managed repositories anymore.
* Use this flag in `.sync.yml` to tell greposync to not create certain files.
====

`unmanaged: true`::
If this flag is set, the target file is not modified.

TIP: Use this flag in `.sync.yml` if a repository maintains its own version of the file outside of {page-component-name}.
