= Sync labels in all repositories

❓ Question::
I want to apply the same set of labels on all repositories.
How do I do that?

📝 Use case::
If all repositories have the same set of label names, colors and descriptions, it will make managing those easier.
Especially useful in cases where a changelog is being created from pull requests that are categorized by labels.

'''

💡 Solution::
Prepare config to manage repository labels:
+
.{page-component-name}.yml
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryLabels:
  greposync:
    name: greposync <1>
    color: FFFFFF <2>
    description: An update by greposync
  goodfirstissue:
    name: good first issue
    delete: true <3>
----
<1> Required property `name`
<2> Set a hexadecimal color without leading `#`
<3> Delete the label by the given name (`.name` is still required)
+
[NOTE]
====
The subkeys in the `repositoryLabels` are irrelevant for {page-component-name} as they are transformed into an array.
But they may later be useful when deep merging with overrides per repository (not implemented).
====
+
Run the `labels` subcommand:
+
[source,bash]
----
gsync labels
