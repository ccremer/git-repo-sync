= Test the rendering of the template with test cases

❓ Question::
How can I ensure that a change in the template is rendered correctly in all repositories before rolling it out?

📝 Use case::
Consider the need for a new "feature flag" value in `{defaults-file}`.
Based on this value, an if-else block in a template is being rendered.
However, we want to test whether this rendering is applied correctly.

'''

💡 Solution::
Prepare 2 test cases:
+
.tests/feature-enabled/{sync-file}
[source,yaml]
----
README.md:
  feature-flag: true
----
+
.tests/feature-disabled/{sync-file}
[source,yaml]
----
README.md:
  feature-flag: false
----
+
Run the `test` subcommand to generate the test output:
+
[source,bash]
----
gsync test
----
+
Copy the test output as a "golden file" back to test case:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -r .tests/feature-enabled tests/feature-enabled
cp -r .tests/feature-disabled tests/feature-disabled
----
+
Edit the expected content based on this feature flag in the `tests` test files.
+
Make sure to implement the template correctly for `README.md`.
Then run the tests again:
+
[source,bash]
----
gsync test --exit-code
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can also create test cases for single files by deleting all other files except the test file:

.tests/readme/{sync-file}
[source,yaml]
----
:globals:
  delete: true
README.md:
  delete: false
  description: test case
----
