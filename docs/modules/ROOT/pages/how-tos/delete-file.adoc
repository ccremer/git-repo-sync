= Remove file in a specific repository

❓ Question::
In my template, I have a file that I don't need in a particular Git repository.
Rendering an empty file is not sufficient.
How can tell {page-component-name} to not create that file?

📝 Use case::
Normally I have `.github/workflows/test.yml` in the template but in `example-repository` that file shouldn't exist.

'''

💡 Solution::
Add the `delete: true` special value to a file.
{page-component-name} will delete that file when updating.
+
.`.sync.yml` in `example-repository`
[source,yaml]
----
.github/workflows/test.yml:
  delete: true
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can delete whole directories when appending `/` to the path:

[source,yaml]
----
my-dir/:
  delete: true
----
Be aware though, that it only applies to files that are in the template.
"Foreign" files are not being deleted.
