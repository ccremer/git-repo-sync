= Ignore file in a repository

❓ Question::
In a repository I maintain a special version of a file that cannot be easily templated.
How can I tell {page-component-name} to ignore this file?

📝 Use case::
Normally I have `Makefile` in the template but in `example-repository` that file is too deviating to be managed by the template.

'''

💡 Solution::
Add the `unmanaged: true` special value to a file.
{page-component-name} will not touch that file when updating.
+
.`.sync.yml` in `example-repository`
[source,yaml]
----
Makefile:
  unmanaged: true
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can ignore whole directories when appending `/` to the path:

[source,yaml]
----
my-dir/:
  unmanaged: true
----
