= Add comment headers to files

❓ Question::
For every templated file I want to add a comment header.
Not all files have the same commenting syntax.
How can I add such comments?

📝 Use case::
Files should contain comments indicating that users shouldn't modify the file at hand.
If {page-component-name} runs again, it would overwrite their changes.

'''

💡 Solution::
Add the `_helpers.tpl` file to the template directory.
It could contain the following content:
+
.template/_helpers.tpl
[source,go]
----
include::example$comment/helpers.tpl[]
----
+
Configure the globals so that it allows flexible prefixes or enclosed comments.
+
.config_defaults.yml
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example$comment/config.yaml[]
----
<1> Simply setting `text=""` will disable the comment.
+
.template/README.md.tpl
[source,markdown]
----
include::example$comment/template.md[]
----
+
This results in a file rendered like this:
+
.README.md
[source,markdown]
----
include::example$comment/result.md[]
----
