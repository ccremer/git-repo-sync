= Remove obsolete files in all repositories

❓ Question::
I need to clean up a file in all managed repositories.
How can I mass-delete it?

📝 Use case::
I am migrating from Travis CI to GitHub actions.
I don't need `.travis.yml` anymore.

'''

💡 Solution::
Add the `delete: true` special value to the file.
{page-component-name} will delete that file in each repository when updating.
+
.`config_defaults.yml` in template repository
[source,yaml]
----
.travis.yml:
  delete: true
----
+
[TIP]
====
Repositories that still need this file (e.g. for legacy reasons) can set `delete: false` in their `.sync.yml`.
