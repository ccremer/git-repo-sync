NAME:
   greposync test - Test the rendered template against test cases

USAGE:
   greposync test [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   Test cases are defined as local, simulated repositories in 'tests' directory, where each subdirectory itself is a separate test case.
   The expected file structure should resemble this format: 
   
   tests
   └── case-1 
       ├── <file>
       └── .sync.yml
   
   'case-1' is the test case name.
   <file> represents any files that are to be rendered (for example README.md, Makefile etc.) with their contents being the desired output.
   '.sync.yml' is the sync config for this simulated repository and it works exactly as the .sync.yml syntax in real repositories.
   
   When running this subcommand, these test cases are picked up and its template output rendered in a new directory '.tests'.
   A 'git diff' will be computed and if it's non-empty, the test case is considered failed.
   
   This command can be used to verify that the template is correct before rolling it out to production repositories.
   

OPTIONS:
   --exclude value              Excludes repositories from updating that match the given filter (regex). Repositories matching both include and exclude filter are still excluded. [$G_EXCLUDE]
   --exit-code                  Exits app with exit code 3 if a test case failed. (default: false) [$G_EXIT_CODE]
   --git.root value             Local relative directory path where git clones repositories into. (default: "repos") [$G_GIT_ROOT_DIR]
   --include value              Includes only repositories in the update that match the given filter (regex). The full URL (including scheme) is matched. [$G_INCLUDE]
   --jobs value, -j value       Jobs is the number of parallel jobs to run. 1 basically means that jobs are run in sequence. (default: 1) [$G_JOBS]
   --log.level value, -v value  Log level that increases verbosity with greater numbers. (default: 0) [$G_LOG_LEVEL]
   --log.showLog                Shows the full log in real-time rather than keeping it hidden until an error occurred. (default: false) [$G_SHOW_LOG]
   --skipBroken                 Skip abort if a repository update encounters an error (default: false) [$G_SKIP_BROKEN]
   --template.root value        The path relative to the current workdir where the template files are located. (default: "template") [$G_TEMPLATE_ROOT_DIR]
